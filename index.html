            <p4><br><br><br>New technology makes it interesting to think about how typography will change in the future. 

Our vision can be stronger with digital equipment and make us see smaller particles. The 3d environment for this project contains shapes that was inspired by the science center Super-Kamiokande located under Mount Ikeno in Japan where they are researching about neutrinos that are flying through our universe. The created typeface is in a similar size to the neutrinos. The letters are unfamiliar and unreadable for people living in 2020. </p4>
        
        <p3>At the starting point of the project a study began to examine japanese letters found in a one piece of a lost poem book from the 10th century “Koyagire” by Tsurayuki Kino. Some of the letters of the 10th century are unreadable in present time which brought ideas about the evolution of future typography. Letters where sketched with brush and ink using inspiration found from the old japanese calligraphy. All the sketches were later scanned, zoomed, digital manipulated and then created into new forms in 3d.

        <p5>During the project questions came up in what directions the alphabet can be read. In virtual future it can be possible to read alphabets in a completely new way than we are used to. A single 3d shape can be read as a full sentence and the movement of the shape can change the meaning. Gravity can be one of the factors that adjust the shape and movement.</p5>
