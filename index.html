        <p3>At the starting point for this project a study began examining how japanese letters from 17th century looked like and how it have changed until today. Some of the letters of the 17th century are unreadable in present time which brought ideas about the evolution of typography. The letters created for this project are unfamiliar and unreadable for todays people as human language will change.

        <p5>During the project questions came up in what directions the alphabet can be read in the future. The letters are tested in 3d world and can be used in virtual reality. In Virtual reality it can be possible to read alphabets in a completely new way than we are used to. The future of typography may also be affected by gravity which can adjust the shape and movement.</p5>

        <p6>The future development of technology makes it interesting to think about how language and typography will change with new possibilities. Inspiration for the letters where found from visual elements in informative sources about spacetime, gravity and string theory. </p6>
